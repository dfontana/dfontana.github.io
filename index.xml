      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s simple: I love what I do. And that&amp;rsquo;s what makes me, well, me. I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring - there&amp;rsquo;s a sea of knowledge out there and not enough time to comprehend it all. It&amp;rsquo;s that passion that pushes me to do better; help others understand more; and deliver meaning from the meaningless.
I&amp;rsquo;ve explored a lot, gaining a medley of side-knowledge from the 9-to-5. Here&amp;rsquo;s just a random smattering of some:</description>

      <description>This one is more or less straight to the point. We&amp;rsquo;re going to setup a fresh raspberry pi in a headless state. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy if you keep your wits about you. Unfortunately you&amp;rsquo;ll need either a keyboard/mouse + monitor or an ethernet connection to your device in order to get the wifi step of these instructions done.

      <description>One of the things I love to do is tinker - to an almost unhealthy degree. Having not been satisfied with the autocompletion bash provides, and curious what alternative shells had to offer, I found ZSH. In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through how I setup ZSH on my Windows machine (inside WSL) - but the instructions compare similarly for my Mac.
First Step, ZSH You&amp;rsquo;ll want to boot up your terminal / WSL terminal and install the ZSH package.</description>

      <description>While standing up a REST API for a work project, I spent a lot of time editing the IP, port, and other parameters within my server as I swapped from production and development environments. After being fed up with the constant back and forth, I searched for a better solution. In this tidbit, I&amp;rsquo;m going to present my solution.
Reading Environment Variables in Node An easy solution would be to simply pass environment variables when launching NodeJS, pulling the configuration from inside our files to the commandline during launch time.</description>
