It's simple: I _love_ what I do. And that's what makes me, well, me. I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring - there's a sea of knowledge out there and not enough time to comprehend it all. It's that _passion_ that pushes me to do better; help others understand more; and deliver meaning from the meaningless.

Random not-9-to-5 things I've done in the past:
- Some fun in NLP & newspapers
- Data-Visualization with D3
- Distributed Neural Nets (Spark2 & Distributed Tensorflow)
- Web Dev-y (PHP, Node, React, Jest, Polymer)
- Desktop Apps with Tauri
- Discord Bots with Serenity-rs
- Rust is fun. Java is okay.
- Linux (Various. Arch, Ubuntu - WSL, Manjaro, Pop, Fedora...)
- ...And more I've likely forgotten to list

But the typical 9-to-5 life:
- High volume, low latency APIs (Java / Springboot, NoSQL)
- Data Pipelines mixing Airflow, Kafka, Flink, Spark, Dataproc, BigQuery.
- Various "admin" web interfaces (React, Java/PHP, SQL)

I'm always exploring new frontiers -- _never ready to settle_.
