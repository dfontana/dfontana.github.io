It's simple: I _love_ what I do. And that's what makes me, well, me. I enjoy learning, reading, and exploring - there's a sea of knowledge out there and not enough time to comprehend it all. It's that _passion_ that pushes me to do better; help others understand more; and deliver meaning from the meaningless.

I've explored a lot, gaining a medley of side-knowledge from the 9-to-5. Here's just a random smattering of some:

- Data Science concepts & some fun in NLP
- Data-Visualization with D3
- Distributed Multi-perceptron training & inference (Powered via Spark2 & Distributed Tensorflow, Tensorboard)
- "Simpler" techniques: Recommender systems, decision trees (& their cousin, the forest)
- AI concepts: Alpha-Beta, Search (A\*).
- Web Dev (PHP, NodeJs, ReactJS, Jest, Polymer)
- Linux (Which flavor? Who knows. Arch, Ubuntu (& it's ugly life in WSL), RedHat, Manjaro)
- etc

Now-a-days, though, I live the life of a Full Stack Developer exploring Redux, GraphQL, InfluxDB, and keeping up with realtime serving. I'm always exploring new frontiers -- _never ready to settle_.
