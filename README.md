### Porfolio
This is my portfolio / personal site currently **under construction**

###### It's *Static*
I wanted the site to be easy to maintain, update, and use. There's nothing that needs to be fancy, so I've decided a static site is the best fit. And to make it *even* easier, I'm exploiting a Static Website Generator, Hugo, to do the dirty work. Hugo is a Go based generator that happens to be [the second most popular on github](https://www.staticgen.com/), just behind Jekyll. Why not trying something new while we're at it?

#### What's Left?
[ ] Author name in foot needs to link to *about*
[ ] About needs to get a photo place, either through markdown or reworking the layout.
